# je - Jobe Engine

The beginnings of a high performance scalable job execution engine for
executing "work" at scale. Typical use-cases include running remediations
in reactions to alarms, simple workflows and everything in between.

**Status:** Early alpha stages, in development.

## TODO

[ ] Split out worker to separate process
[ ] Build simple CLI to invoke and manage jobs
